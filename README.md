# Tidymodels Introduction

**Date:** 05.02.2026  
**File:** intro_tidymodels.qmd

## Overview

An introduction script to  **tidymodels** framework.

## Structure

1.  **A simple workflow**  Quick snapshot — fit a model and make predictions 
2.  **Building Blocks** Individual components: recipes, parsnip, workflows, yardstick 
3.  **Full Workflow** A workable real workflow with split at start
4.  **Summary** Lists core packages

## Approach
1. **Uses penguins** — Consistent with prior chapters

2.  **Barebone workflow** — Introduces a working barebone code based on the tidymodels philosophy.
3. **Yardstick on training data first** — Mainly for simplicity, but this cna be easily altered.
4. **rsample later on** - Introduces splitting later on in a full workflow eexample
3. **tune is omitted** — Hyperparameter tuning is omitted partially due to its increased complexity. But I can do it if deemed to be needed.
